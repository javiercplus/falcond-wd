# falcond - Advanced Linux Gaming Performance Daemon

falcond is a powerful system daemon designed to automatically optimize your Linux gaming experience. It intelligently manages system resources and performance settings on a per-game basis, eliminating the need to manually configure settings for each game.

## Features

- **Automatic Game Detection**: Automatically detects running games and applies optimized settings
- **Per-Game Profiles**: Customizable profiles for different games
- **Performance Mode**: Enables system-wide performance optimizations when gaming
- **3D vcache Management**: Smart management of AMD 3D vcache settings
- **SCX Scheduler Integration**: Dynamically pick a scheduler that is best for the specific game
- **DMEM Cgroup Protection**: Optional GPU/device-memory protection for active profiles on supported kernels
- **Split Lock Mitigation**: Optional per-profile disable of `kernel.split_lock_mitigate` for games that need it
- **Proton Compatibility**: Full support for Steam Proton games, with a global profile for excellent game coverage
- **Low Overhead**: Minimal system resource usage
- **Different Device Modes**: Profiles for desktops, handhelds, HTPC etc

## Installation

### PikaOS

falcond is available on PikaOS via the falcond package or via the Pika Gameutils Metapackage.

### Void Linux

Install dependencies and build with zig 0.16.0:

```bash
sudo xbps-install -S power-profiles-daemon scx scx-loader dbus sudo git
git clone https://github.com/PikaOS-Linux/falcond.git
cd falcond/falcond
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast -Dcpu=x86_64_v3
sudo install -Dm755 zig-out/bin/falcond /usr/bin/falcond
```

Install profiles:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/PikaOS-Linux/falcond-profiles.git /tmp/profiles
sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/falcond
sudo cp -r /tmp/profiles/usr/share/falcond/* /usr/share/falcond/
rm -rf /tmp/profiles
```

Enable runit services:

```bash
sudo ln -sf /etc/sv/power-profiles-daemon /var/service/
sudo ln -sf /etc/sv/scx-loader /var/service/
sudo mkdir -p /etc/sv/falcond
sudo install -m755 runit/falcond/run /etc/sv/falcond/run
sudo ln -sf /etc/sv/falcond /var/service/
sudo sv start falcond
```

For other distributions, please check your package manager or build from source.

## Configuration

The configuration file is located at `/etc/falcond/config.conf`. Here's an example configuration, it will be generated automatically on first run:

```
enable_performance_mode = true
scx_sched = none
scx_sched_props = default
vcache_mode = none
profile_mode = none
```

This is global configuration and all options other than profile_mode override individual game profiles. Global `scx_sched` / `vcache_mode` set at daemon start remain in effect when idle; profile activate/deactivate restores the pre-profile snapshot (typically those globals), not an unset state.

There is also a list of proton/wine system processes in `/usr/share/falcond/system.conf`. This list can be updated if for example a crash handler is intercepting your profile and needs to be ignored.

### Configuration Options

- `enable_performance_mode`: Enable/disable performance mode (default: true)
- `scx_sched`: SCX scheduler (options: none, bpfland, lavd, rusty, flash)
- `scx_sched_props`: SCX scheduler mode (options: default, gaming, power, latency, server)
- `vcache_mode`: VCache management mode (options: none, cache, freq)
- `profile_mode`: What type of device is in use, none means desktop (options: none, handheld, htpc)
- `poll_interval_ms`: Process scanning interval in milliseconds (default: 9000)

## Profile Modes
Falcond now supports different profile modes for different device types:
- Default (none): Uses profiles from `/usr/share/falcond/profiles`
- Handheld: Uses profiles from `/usr/share/falcond/profiles/handheld`
- HTPC: Uses profiles from `/usr/share/falcond/profiles/htpc`

To set a profile mode, add this to your config file:
```
profile_mode = "handheld" # or "htpc" or "none"
```

## Game Profiles

Game profiles are stored in `/usr/share/falcond/profiles/` and define specific optimizations for individual games. You can contribute new profiles via PR at:
[Falcond Profiles Repository](https://github.com/PikaOS-Linux/falcond-profiles)

### User Profiles

falcond supports user-specific profiles that override system profiles. User profiles are stored in `/usr/share/falcond/profiles/user/` and take precedence over system profiles with the same name. This allows you to customize game settings without modifying system files.

To create a user profile:
1. Create the directory if it doesn't exist: `sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/falcond/profiles/user/`
2. Create a profile file with the game's name: `sudo nano /usr/share/falcond/profiles/user/game.conf`
3. Add your custom settings

User profiles follow the same format as system profiles but will override any system profile with the same name. If a user profile doesn't exist for a game, the system profile will be used.

Example profile:
```
name = "game.exe"
performance_mode = true
scx_sched = bpfland
scx_sched_props = gaming
vcache_mode = cache
start_script = "/home/ferreo/start.sh"
stop_script = "notify-send 'game stopped'"
dmem_protect = true
disable_split_lock = true
```

### Available Options

- `name`: The exe name (examples: cs2, PathOfExileSteam.exe)
- `performance_mode`: Enable/disable performance mode (default: true)
- `scx_sched`: SCX scheduler (options: none, bpfland, lavd, rusty, flash)
- `scx_sched_props`: SCX scheduler mode (options: none, gaming, power, latency, server)
- `vcache_mode`: VCache management mode (options: none, cache, freq)
- `start_script`: Script to run when the game starts (trusted config: runs via `/bin/sh -c` as the game UID when falcond is root; `DISPLAY` is taken from the game process environ when available, else `:0`)
- `stop_script`: Script to run when the game stops (same trust model as `start_script`)
- `idle_inhibit`: Prevent screensaver/idle while game is running (default: false)
- `dmem_protect`: Move matched profile processes into a falcond-managed child cgroup and protect their GPU/device memory with `dmem.low` while active (default: false)
- `disable_split_lock`: Temporarily set `kernel.split_lock_mitigate=0` while the profile is active, then restore the previous value on exit (default: false). Useful for games that misbehave under the kernel's split-lock "misery mode" (e.g. Space Marine 2). Requires root (falcond runs as a system daemon).

`dmem_protect` requires cgroup v2, a kernel with `CONFIG_CGROUP_DMEM`, a compatible GPU driver, and a hierarchy where the dmem controller can be enabled for the game cgroup. Current systems may require `dmemcg-booster` or equivalent hierarchy preparation. The feature is optional and profiles still activate when dmem is unavailable.

## Service Management

### systemd

```bash
sudo systemctl restart falcond
sudo systemctl status falcond
```

### runit (Void Linux)

```bash
sudo sv restart falcond
sudo sv status falcond
```

## Source Code

The source code for falcond can be found at:
[Falcond Source Repository](https://git.pika-os.com/general-packages/falcond)

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Compatibility Warning** ⚠️ falcond should not be used alongside Feral GameMode or Falcon GameMode as they may conflict with each other. falcond provides similar functionality with additional features and optimizations.

## Why falcond?

Traditional gaming on Linux often requires manual optimization for each game - tweaking CPU governors, scheduling priorities, and cache settings. falcond automates this entire process by:

1. Automatically detecting when games are running
2. Applying optimized settings based on pre-configured profiles
3. Reverting settings when games are closed
4. Providing a centralized way to manage gaming performance
5. Easy switching of options for different device types

This means you can focus on gaming while falcond handles all the technical optimizations in the background!

## Contributing

Please fork the [PikaOS-Linux/falcond](https://github.com/PikaOS-Linux/falcond) repository and submit a pull request.

## Build Dependencies

- zig 0.16.0+
- libc development headers

## Building from Source

```
git clone https://git.pika-os.com/general-packages/falcond.git
cd falcond/falcond
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

### Build Path Options

All file paths are configurable at build time via `-D` flags. These are comptime values with zero runtime overhead. The defaults match the standard FHS layout used by PikaOS packaging:

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `-Dconfig-path` | `/etc/falcond/config.conf` | Path to the main config file |
| `-Dprofiles-dir` | `/usr/share/falcond/profiles` | Path to system profiles directory |
| `-Duser-profiles-dir` | `/usr/share/falcond/profiles/user` | Path to user profile overrides |
| `-Dsystem-conf-path` | `/usr/share/falcond/system.conf` | Path to the system process list |
| `-Dstatus-file` | `/var/lib/falcond/status` | Path to the persistent status file (parent directory is created automatically) |
| `-Dtmp-status-file` | `/tmp/falcond_status` | Path to the tmpfs status file (3rd-party contract; atomic rename) |

Example building with custom paths:
```
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast -Dconfig-path=/opt/falcond/config.conf -Dstatus-file=/run/falcond/status
```

## Runtime Dependencies

These should be feature detected by falcond so if not present that specific feature will not be used.

power-profiles-daemon or tuned + tuned-ppd
scx-sched
Linux kernel patched with AMD 3D vcache support
Linux kernel with CONFIG_CGROUP_DMEM and dmem-capable GPU driver for dmem_protect
dbus and sudo

## Packaging

falcond should be placed in /usr/bin/falcond and run via a service file.

- **systemd**: Service file at `debian/falcond.service`
- **runit**: Service files at `runit/falcond/`

falcond needs profiles to be useful, these should be placed in /usr/share/falcond/profiles alongside the system.conf in /usr/share/falcond/system.conf. Upto date profiles can be found in the [PikaOS-Linux/falcond-profiles](https://github.com/PikaOS-Linux/falcond-profiles) repository. We currently pull the latest profiles from there on building of this package but you could also package seperately and depend on that package.

There is a config file in /etc/falcond/config.conf which is generated automatically on first run. You could also package that if you need different default settings.

### Void Linux (xbps-src)

A template for xbps-src is available in `void/template`. To build the package:

```bash
cd void-packages
cp -r /path/to/falcond/void srcpkgs/falcond
